1)Write a Python program to read an entire text file. 

def file_read(fname):
        txt = open(fname)
        print(txt.read())

file_read('test.txt')


2)Write a Python program to read a file line by line and store it into a list.

def file_read(fname):
        with open(fname) as f:
                #Content_list is the list that contains the read lines.     
                content_list = f.readlines()
                print(content_list)

file_read(\'test.txt\')

3) Write a Python program to read a random line from a file

 import random
def random_line(fname):
    lines = open(fname).read().splitlines()
    return random.choice(lines)
print(random_line('test.txt'))

4)Write a Python program to generate 26 text files named A.txt, B.txt, and so on up to Z.txt.

import string, os
if not os.path.exists("letters"):
   os.makedirs("letters")
for letter in string.ascii_uppercase:
   with open(letter + ".txt", "w") as f:
       f.writelines(letter)

5)Write a Python program to create a file where all letters of English alphabet are listed by specified number of letters on each line. 

import string
def letters_file_line(n):
   with open("words1.txt", "w") as f:
       alphabet = string.ascii_uppercase
       letters = [alphabet[i:i + n] + "\n" for i in range(0, len(alphabet), n)]
       f.writelines(letters)
letters_file_line(3)
