1)Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer,n .
Constraints
â€¢	1<=n<=100
Output Format
Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.
Sample Input 0
3
Sample Output 0
Weird
Sample Input 1
24
Sample Output 1
Not Weird
Explanation
Sample Case 0: n=3
 n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.
Sample Case 1:  n=24
 n> 20 and  is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.

ANS:
          X=input("")
	n = int(x)
	if n % 2 == 1:
	    print("Weird")
	elif n % 2 == 0 and 2 <= n <= 5:
	    print("Not Weird")
	elif n % 2 == 0 and 6 <= n <= 20:
	    print("Weird")
	else:
	    print("Not Weird")


2)Read an integer N . For all non-negative integers i<N , print i2 . See the sample for details.
Input Format
The first and only line contains the integer,N .
Constraints
1<=N,=20
Output Format
Print  N lines, one corresponding to each  i.

ANS:

a=input("")
n=int(a)
for i in range(0,n):
    print(i*i)

3). Read two integers and print two lines. The first line should contain integer division,  a//b . The second line should contain float division, a /b .
You don't need to perform any rounding or formatting operations.
Input Format
The first line contains the first integer, a. The second line contains the second integer,b .
Output Format
Print the two lines as described above.

ANS:

a = input("")
n1 = int(a)
b = input("")
n2 = int(b)
print(n1 // n2)
print(n1 / n2)
