1. Write a python program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5 between 2000 and 3200 (both included). 
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.


for i in range(2000,3201):
    if i%7 == 0 and i%5!=0:
        print(i,end=',')
print("\b")



2.Write a python program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world
Practice makes perfect
Then, the output should be:
HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT


def user_input():
    while True:
        s = input()
        if not s:
            return
        yield s

for line in map(str.upper, user_input()):
    print(line)



3.Write a python program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!
Then, the output should be:
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9


def string_test(s):
    d={"UPPER_CASE":0, "LOWER_CASE":0}
    for c in s:
        if c.isupper():
           d["UPPER_CASE"]+=1
        elif c.islower():
           d["LOWER_CASE"]+=1
        else:
           pass
    print ("Original String : ", s)
    print ("No. of Upper case characters : ", d["UPPER_CASE"])
    print ("No. of Lower case Characters : ", d["LOWER_CASE"])

string_test('Hello world!')
