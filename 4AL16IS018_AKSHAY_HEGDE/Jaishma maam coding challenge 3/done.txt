TASK 1:
Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:
1. insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
2. print: Print the list.
3. remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e .
4. append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
5. sort: Sort the list.
6. pop: Pop the last element from the list.
7. reverse: Reverse the list.
Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands
where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. Iterate through each
command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list

arr = []
for i in range(int(raw_input())):
 s = raw_input().split()
 for i in range(1,len(s)):
 s[i] = int(s[i])

 if s[0] == "append":
 arr.append(s[1])
 elif s[0] == "extend":
 arr.extend(s[1:])
 elif s[0] == "insert":
 arr.insert(s[1],s[2])
 elif s[0] == "remove":
 arr.remove(s[1])
 elif s[0] == "pop":
 arr.pop()
 elif s[0] == "index":
 print arr.index(s[1])
 elif s[0] == "count":
 print arr.count(s[1])
 elif s[0] == "sort":
 arr.sort()
 elif s[0] == "reverse":
 arr.reverse()
 elif s[0] == "print":
 print arr

TASK 2:
Given an integer, n, and n space-separated integers as input, create a tuple, t, of
those n integers. Then compute and print the result of hash(t).
Note: hash() is one of the functions in the __builtins__ module, so it need not be
imported.

Solution:
n = input()
str = input()
lst = str.split()
lst = map(int, lst)
t = tuple(lst)
print(hash(t))

TASK 3:
You have a record of N students. Each record contains the student's name, and
their percent marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. The marks can be floating
values. The user enters some integer N followed by the names and marks
for N students. You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type. The 
user then enters a student's name. Output the average percentage marks obtained by
that student, correct to two decimal places.

Solution:
N = int(raw_input())
results = {}
for i in range(N):
 a = raw_input().split(' ')
 results[a[0]] = [float(x) for x in a[1:]]
student = raw_input()
print "%.2f" %(sum(results[student])/len(results[student]))
