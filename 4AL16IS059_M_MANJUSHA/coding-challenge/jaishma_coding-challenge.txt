1.	Given an integer n, , perform the following conditional actions:
•	If  n is odd, print Weird
•	If n is even and in the inclusive range of  2 to 5 , print Not Weird
•	If  n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20 , print Weird
•	If  n is even and greater than 20 , print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.
Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer,n .
Constraints
•	1<=n<=100
Output Format
Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.
Sample Input 0
3
Sample Output 0
Weird
Sample Input 1
24
Sample Output 1
Not Weird
Explanation
Sample Case 0: n=3
 n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.
Sample Case 1:  n=24
 n> 20 and  is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.\

Solution: n = int(input())
if n % 2 == 1:
    print("Weird")
elif n % 2 == 0 and 2 <= n <= 5:
    print("Not Weird")
elif n % 2 == 0 and 6 <= n <= 20:
    print("Weird")
else:
    print("Not Weird")

2.  Read an integer N . For all non-negative integers i<N , print i2 . See the sample for details.
Input Format
The first and only line contains the integer,N .
Constraints
1<=N,=20
Output Format
Print  N lines, one corresponding to each  i.

Solution:  n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
if i < n:
print(i**2)


3. Read two integers and print two lines. The first line should contain integer division,  a//b . The second line should contain float division, a /b .
You don't need to perform any rounding or formatting operations.
Input Format
The first line contains the first integer, a. The second line contains the second integer,b .
Output Format
Print the two lines as described above.
Sample Input 0
4
3
Sample Output 0
1
1.33333333333

Solution:  a = input("")
n1 = int(a)
b = input("")
n2 = int(b)
print(n1 // n2)
print(n1 / n2)
