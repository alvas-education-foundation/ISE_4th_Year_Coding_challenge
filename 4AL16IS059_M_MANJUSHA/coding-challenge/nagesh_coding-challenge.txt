1)Write a python program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5 between 2000 and 
3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

solution:


for i in range(2000,3201):
    if i%7 == 0 and i%5!=0:
        print(i,end=',')
print("\b")



2)Write a python program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world
Practice makes perfect
Then, the output should be:
HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

solution:
def user_input():
    while True:
        s = input()
        if not s:
            return
        yield s

for line in map(str.upper, user_input()):
    print(line)



3)Write a python program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!
Then, the output should be:
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9


solution:
s = raw_input()
d={"UPPER CASE":0, "LOWER CASE":0}
for c in s:
    if c.isupper():
        d["UPPER CASE"]+=1
    elif c.islower():
        d["LOWER CASE"]+=1
    else:
        pass
print "UPPER CASE", d["UPPER CASE"]
print "LOWER CASE", d["LOWER CASE"]
