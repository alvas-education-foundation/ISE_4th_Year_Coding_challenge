1)Python program to check if year is a leap year or not

year = 2000

# To get year (integer input) from the user
# year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if (year % 4) == 0:
   if (year % 100) == 0:

   else:
       print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))
else:
   print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))

2)python program to find the largest number among the three input numbers

# change the values of num1, num2 and num3
# for a different result
num1 = 10
num2 = 14
num3 = 12

# uncomment following lines to take three numbers from user
#num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
#num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

   largest = num1
elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
   largest = num2
else:
   largest = num3

print("The largest number is", largest)


3)Program to check if a number is prime or not

num = 407

# To take input from the user
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# prime numbers are greater than 1
if num > 1:
   # check for factors
   for i in range(2,num):
       if (num % i) == 0:
           print(num,"is not a prime number")
           print(i,"times",num//i,"is",num)
           break
   else:
       print(num,"is a prime number")
       
# if input number is less than
# or equal to 1, it is not prime
else:
   print(num,"is not a prime number")

4)python program to display all the prime numbers within an interval

lower = 900
upper = 1000

print("Prime numbers between", lower, "and", upper, "are:")

for num in range(lower, upper + 1):
   # all prime numbers are greater than 1
   if num > 1:
       for i in range(2, num):
           if (num % i) == 0:
               break
       else:
           print(num)

5)Python program to find the factorial of a number provided by the user.

# change the value for a different result
num = 7

# To take input from the user
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

factorial = 1

# check if the number is negative, positive or zero
if num < 0:
   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
   for i in range(1,num + 1):
       factorial = factorial*i
   print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)
