1) Write a python program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5 between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Solution:
nl=[]
for x in range(1500, 2701):
    if (x%7==0) and (x%5==0):
        nl.append(str(x))
print (','.join(nl))



2) Write a python program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world
Practice makes perfect
Then, the output should be:
HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

Solution: 
lines = []
while True:
    l = input()
    if l:
        lines.append(l.upper())
    else:
        break;

for l in lines:
    print(l)


3)Write a python program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!
Then, the output should be:
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9

Solution: 
def string_test(s):
    d={"UPPER_CASE":0, "LOWER_CASE":0}
    for c in s:
        if c.isupper():
           d["UPPER_CASE"]+=1
        elif c.islower():
           d["LOWER_CASE"]+=1
        else:
           pass
    print ("Original String : ", s)
    print ("No. of Upper case characters : ", d["UPPER_CASE"])
    print ("No. of Lower case Characters : ", d["LOWER_CASE"])

string_test('The quick Brown Fox')
