#1.Mr. Vincent works in a door mat manufacturing company. One day, he designed a new door mat with the following specifications:

Mat size must be N*M ( N is an odd natural number, M and  is  3times N .)
The design should have 'WELCOME' written in the center.
The design pattern should only use |, . and - characters.

N, M = map(int,raw_input().split()) # More than 6 lines of code will result in 0 score. Blank lines are not counted.
for i in xrange(0,N/2): 
    print ('.|.'*i).rjust((M-2)/2,'-')+'.|.'+('.|.'*i).ljust((M-2)/2,'-')
print 'WELCOME'.center(M,'-')
for i in reversed(xrange(0,N/2)): 
    print ('.|.'*i).rjust((M-2)/2,'-')+'.|.'+('.|.'*i).ljust((M-2)/2,'-')

2. You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as Alison Heck.
Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

def solve(s):

    for i in s.split():
        s = s.replace(i,i.capitalize())
    return s


if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    s = raw_input()

    result = solve(s)

    fptr.write(result + '\n')

    fptr.close()

3. Given an integer n, , perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5 , print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20 , print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20 , print Not Weird

n = input("")
if n%2!=0 :
    print ("Weird")
elif n%2==0 :
    for n in range(3,4,5) :
            print ("Not Weird")
elif n%2==0 :
    for n in range(6,21) :
            print ("Weird")
else :
    if (n%2==0 & n>20) :
        print ("Not Weird")

4. Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(raw_input())
    b = int(raw_input())
  

print a + b
print a - b
print a * b

5.Given an integer n, , print the following values for each integer i from 1  to n:

Decimal
Octal
Hexadecimal (capitalized)
Binary
The four values must be printed on a single line in the order specified above for each i  from 1 to n . Each value should be space-padded to match the width of the binary value of n .

def print_formatted(number):
    a=len('{:b}'.format(n))+1
    for i in range (1,n+1):
        print((str(i)).rjust(a-1," ")+(str('{:o}'.format(i))).rjust(a," ") +(str('{:X}'.format(i))).rjust(a," ") +(str('{:b}'.format(i))).rjust(a," "))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    print_formatted(n)
