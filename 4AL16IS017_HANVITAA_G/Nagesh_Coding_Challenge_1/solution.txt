Challenge-1:

Write a python program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are
not a multiple of 5 between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should
be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Solution:

l=[]
for i in range (2000,3201)
 if (i%7==0) and (i%5!=0):
 l.append(str(i))
print(‘,’ .join(l))


Challenge-2:

Write a python program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after
making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world
Practice makes perfect
Then, the output should be:
HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

Solution:

lines = []
while True:
 l = input()
 if l:
 lines.append(l.upper())
 else:
 break;
for l in lines:
 print(l)



Challenge-3:

Write a python program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case
letters and lower case letters.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!
Then, the output should be:
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9

Solution:

Phrase =input(“Type in: ”)
phrase = list(phrase)
u, l = 0, 0
for i in phrase:
 if i.isupper():
 u = u + 1
 if i.islower():
 l = l + 1
 else:
 pass
print("UPPER:", u)
print("lower:", l)
