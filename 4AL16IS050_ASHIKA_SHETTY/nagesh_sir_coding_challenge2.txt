1). Write a python program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. 
The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.

items = []
num = [x for x in input().split(',')]
for p in num:
    x = int(p, 2)
    if not x%5:
        items.append(p)
print(','.join(items))


2).  Write a python program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.

s = input("Input a string")
d=l=0
for c in s:
    if c.isdigit():
        d=d+1
    elif c.isalpha():
        l=l+1
    else:
        pass
print("Letters", l)
print("Digits", d)


3).  Write a python program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically. 


import operator

text_line = input("Type in: ")

freq_dict = {}

for i in text_line.split(' '):
    if i.isalpha():
        if i not in freq_dict:
            freq_dict[i] = 1
        elif i in freq_dict:
            freq_dict[i] = freq_dict[i] + 1
    else:
        pass
        

sorted_freq_dict = sorted(freq_dict.items(), key = operator.itemgetter(0))
print(sorted_freq_dict)

for i in sorted_freq_dict:
    print(i[0], i[1])


4).  Define a class named Rectangle which can be constructed by a length and width. The Rectangle class has a method which can compute the area.


class Rectangle():
    def __init__(self, l, w):
        self.length = l
        self.width  = w

    def rectangle_area(self):
        return self.length*self.width

newRectangle = Rectangle(12, 10)
print(newRectangle.rectangle_area())_
