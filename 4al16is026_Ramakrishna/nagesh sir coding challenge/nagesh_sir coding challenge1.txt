1) Write a python program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5 between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Solution:
nl=[]
for x in range(1500, 2701):
    if (x%7==0) and (x%5==0):
        nl.append(str(x))
print (','.join(nl))



2) Write a python program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world
Practice makes perfect
Then, the output should be:
HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

Solution: 
lines = []
while True:
    l = input()
    if l:
        lines.append(l.upper())
    else:
        break;

for l in lines:
    print(l)


3)Write a python program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!
Then, the output should be:
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9

Solution: 

s=input("Enter the string:")
a1=0
a2=0
for i in s:
      if(i.islower()):
            a1=a1+1
      elif(i.isupper()):
            a2=a2+1
print("The number of lowercase characters is:")
print(a1)
print("The number of uppercase characters is:")
print(a2)
