Given two given numbers a and b where 1<=a<=b, find the number of perfect squares between a and b (a and b inclusive).

Input:
First line of input contains number of test cases T. Each line of test case contain numbers 'a' and 'b' seperated by a single space.

Output:
Number of perfect squares are displayed.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= a,b <= 105 
Example:
Input:
2
9 25
1 1000

Output:
3
31
