1.  You are given the year, and you have to write a function to check if the year is leap or not.


def is_leap(year):
    if year % 400 == 0:
        return True
    if year % 100 == 0:
        return False
    if year % 4 == 0:
        return True
    return False



2. Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:
1.	The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2.	The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3.	The third line contains the product of the two numbers.


a = int(input())
b = int(input())

print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)


3. Read an integer  N.
Without using any string methods, try to print the following:
 1 2 3 ….. N
Note that “ …..” represents the values in between.


n = int(raw_input())
    list = []
    num = 1
    string = "" 
    for x in range(n):
        list.append(num)
        num += 1
    for x in list:
        string += str(x)
    print(string)
