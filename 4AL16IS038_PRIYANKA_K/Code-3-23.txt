The expression re.findall() returns all the non-overlapping matches of patterns in a string as a list of strings.
Code

>>> import re
>>> re.findall(r'\w','http://www.hackerrank.com/')
['h', 't', 't', 'p', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'h', 'a', 'c', 'k', 'e', 'r', 'r', 'a', 'n', 'k', 'c', 'o', 'm']
re.finditer()
The expression re.finditer() returns an iterator yielding MatchObject instances over all non-overlapping matches for the re pattern in the string.
Code

>>> import re
>>> re.finditer(r'\w','http://www.hackerrank.com/')
<callable-iterator object at 0x0266C790>
>>> map(lambda x: x.group(),re.finditer(r'\w','http://www.hackerrank.com/'))
['h', 't', 't', 'p', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'h', 'a', 'c', 'k', 'e', 'r', 'r', 'a', 'n', 'k', 'c', 'o', 'm']
Task
You are given a string . It consists of alphanumeric characters, spaces and symbols(+,-).
Your task is to find all the substrings of  that contains  or more vowels.
Also, these substrings must lie in between  consonants and should contain vowels only.

Note :
Vowels are defined as: AEIOU and aeiou.
Consonants are defined as: QWRTYPSDFGHJKLZXCVBNM and qwrtypsdfghjklzxcvbnm.

Input Format

A single line of input containing string .

Constraints


Output Format

Print the matched substrings in their order of occurrence on separate lines.
If no match is found, print -1.

Sample Input

Sample Output

ee
Ioo
Oeo
eeeee
Explanation

ee is located between consonant  and .
Ioo is located between consonant  and .
Oeo is located between consonant  and .
eeeee is located between consonant  and .

Program:

import re
v = "aeiou"
c = "qwrtypsdfghjklzxcvbnm"
m = re.findall(r"(?<=[%s])([%s]{2,})[%s]" % (c, v, c), input(), flags = re.I)
print('\n'.join(m or ['-1']))
