import java.util.*;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    String[] s=new String[]{"break","case","continue","default","defer","else","for","func","goto","if","map","range","return","struct","type","var"};
		List<String> l=Arrays.asList(s);
		Scanner sin=new Scanner(System.in);
		String s1=sin.nextLine();
		if(l.contains(s1))
		  System.out.println(s1+" is a keyword");
		  else
		  System.out.println(s1+" is not a keyword");
