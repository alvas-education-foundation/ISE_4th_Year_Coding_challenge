1). 1. Given a maximum of 100 digit numbers as input, find the difference between the sum of odd and even position digits
Test Cases

Case 1
Input: 4567
Expected Output: 2

Explanation : Odd positions are 4 and 6 as they are pos: 1 and pos: 3, both have sum 10. Similarly, 5 and 7 are at even positions pos: 2 and pos: 4 with sum 12. Thus, difference is 12 â€“ 10 = 2

Case 2
Input: 5476
Expected Output: 2

Case 3
Input: 9834698765123
Expected Output: 1
