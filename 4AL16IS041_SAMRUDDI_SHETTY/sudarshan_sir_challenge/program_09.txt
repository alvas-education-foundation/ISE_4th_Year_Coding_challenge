Activity 1
Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). 
The fee structure is as follows:
1.	If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.:fine=0).
2.	If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date :fine=Rs.15*(No. Of Days)
3.	If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine=Rs.500*(No. Of Days).
4.	If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of Rs. 10000.
Input Format
1.	The first line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective DD,MM, YY on which the book was actually returned.
2.	The second line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective DD,MM, YY on which the book was expected to be returned (due date).
Constraints
1.	DD={1 to 31}
2.	MM={1 to 12}
3.	YY={1 to 3000}
4.	Accept only valid dates

Output Format
Print a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input.
