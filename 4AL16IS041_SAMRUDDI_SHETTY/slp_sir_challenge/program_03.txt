1). Using whatever programming techniques you know, write the cleanest possible function you can think 
of to print a singly linked list in reverse. The format for the node should be a struct containing 
an integer value, val, and a next pointer to the following node.



#include <stdio.h>

struct node
{
    int val;
    struct node* next;
};

void print_reverse( struct node* list )
{
    if ( list != 0 )
    {
        print_reverse( list->next );
        printf( "%d\n", list->val );
    }
}
