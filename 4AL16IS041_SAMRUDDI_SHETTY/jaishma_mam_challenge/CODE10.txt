1). Given a two list. 
Create a third list by picking an odd-index element from the first list and even index elements from second.



listOne = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
listTwo = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]
listThree = list()

oddElements = listOne[1::2]
print("Element at odd-index positions from list one")
print(oddElements)

EvenElement = listTwo[0::2]
print("Element at even-index positions from list two")
print(EvenElement)

print("Printing Final third list")
listThree.extend(oddElements)
listThree.extend(EvenElement)
print(listThree)
